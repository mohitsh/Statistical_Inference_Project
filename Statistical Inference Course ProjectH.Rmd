#### Overview
In this report 1000 simulations have been done to perform 40 experiments on exponantial distribution.
The simulation resuled in almost same mean and variance as our theoretical Value.

```{r}
lambda = .2
n = 10
rexp(n,lambda)
mean=1/lambda
sd = 1/lambda
var = sd^2

# comparison of simluataion mean and theoretical mean
matrix1 <- matrix(rexp(40000,.2),nrow=1000,ncol=40)


```
##### In the above code a simulation is performed to generate a 1000*40 matrix
##### which has 1000 simulations to generate 40 exponantial distribution observations.   

##### Theoretically both mean and variance have value 1/lambda.
